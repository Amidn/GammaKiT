Summary
~~~~~~~

This release introduces a number of performance improvements, new features and bug fixes.
There has been significant code cleanup, specially with respect to the documentaion and three new tutorials have been added.

This release is compatible with numpy >=2.0. 


API changes
~~~~~~~~~~~

No new API breaking changes have been introducted in this version.
Features deprecated since Gammapy v1.2 have been removed. 


New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

*gammapy.catalogs*

- Support for the 2PC and 3PC pulsar catalogs from Fermi-LAT is now added.


*gammapy.datasets*

- Performance improvement in Fermi-LAT analysis with adaption in psf kernel computation.
- Stacking of acceptance maps improved.


*gammapy.maps*

- Multiple non-spatial axes supported in creation on MapDatasets. Full likelihood computation with additional axes not yet supported.
- Map axes with periodic boundary conditions are now supported.
- An error is raised for maps with invalid input shapes instead of silently broadcasting.

*gammapy.estimators*

- Binwise likelihood profiles are now stored on FluxMaps. FluxMaps obtained from different datasets can be combined.
- A new tutorial explaining the general Estimator API has been added.
- A new tutorial showing how to perform time dependent spectroscopy has been added.

*gammapy.stats*

- Implementation of the Timmer-Koenig algorithm with leakage protection to simulate a time series from a power spectrum.
- Computation of the discrete structure function for a variable source using Emmanoulopoulos et al. (2010) algorithm.
- Computation of the discrete cross correlation function added.



*gammapy.modeling*

- Unique naming of model parameters adapted, leading to resolution of issues with computation of the covariance matrix for complex model lists.
- New tutorial added for modeling EBL absorption.
- Time scale issue in simulation energy dependent temporal models resolved.
- Definition of `UniformPrior` fixed to return 0 within min and max values indstead of one.
