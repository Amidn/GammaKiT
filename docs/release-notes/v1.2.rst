Summary
~~~~~~~

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- A general scheme for metadata support has been introduced. The ``Metadata`` base
  class has been designed according to PIG X.
- Prototype support for asymmetric IRF. A tutorial exposing how to create such IRFs
  has been added.
- Added position as a parameter for the ``TemplateSpatialModel``. Add a caveat.
- New helper classes have been added to perform event sampling.
- A checksum option has been added on read and write methods in Gammapy. It follows the
  FITS standard and reuses the astropy methods and behavior. A checksum for yaml file
  has been introduced as well.
- Added ``Prior`` class.
- Added a function to remove a time interval from a ``GTI``.
- Total observation time map.
- Introduce timing utility functions: point to point flux variance
- Update 4FGL to DR4



API changes
~~~~~~~~~~~

- The ``norm`` parameter is now passed as an argument to the various flux estimators.
  ``Parameter.is_norm`` is now deprecated.
- The default index of ``ExpCutoffPowerlawNormSpectralModel`` has been changed to 0
  for consistency with the ``PowerlawNormSpectralModel``.

Bug fixes and improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Correct ``MapDataset.info_dict()`` to use background model rather than IRF background when
  giving excess counts and significance.
- Import ray only when needed.
- Added information on number of degrees of freedom on ``FluxMaps`` and ``FluxPoints`` objects.
- Reduced memory usage of ``MapEvaluator`` and ``PSFMap.get_psf_kernel()``.
- Added support for multiprocessing in ``FluxProfileEstimator``.
- Added multiprocessing for ``WcsNDMap`` convolution.
- Add a context manager for multiprocessing.
- Add a faster reprojection method : ``reproject_by_image``.
- Use interpolation for dardk matter mass. Add Zhao profile and
  ``DarkMatterDecaySpectralModel``.
- The asymmetric errors and upper limit calculations in ``CashCountsStatistic``
  have been replaced by an equivalent analytical expression.
