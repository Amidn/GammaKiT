PIG 18 - Documentation

* Status: draft
* Discussion: `GH tbd`_

Abstract
========

Over the past years the Gammapy package and documentation has grown organically,
at the moment there's a lot of duplicated and missing content. We propose to
spend significant effort to restructure and improve the Gammapy tutorial and
documentation content now in fall 2019. This PIG outlines the status and
proposal how to structure the documentation, including a task list what
documentation to add, remove, move or rewrite to get to the desired state.

Proposal
========

In this section we propose many changes. However, we don't consider any of them
a blocker for the v1.0 release. We should improve as much as we can in 2019, but
expect that some of the suggestions here will be implemented and some won't, and
that's fine, the work can simply continue in 2020.
