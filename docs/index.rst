As mentioned in the :ref:`getting-started`, the Gammapy package is structured as
a series of sub-packages. We recommend that you start to learn Gammapy via the
:ref:`tutorials`, and then consult the following pages for further information
about each sub-package. Those pages also contain very detailed reference
documentation for every function and class in Gammapy.
