Gammapy is a community-developed, open-source Python package for gamma-ray
astronomy built on Numpy, Scipy and Astropy. It is the core library for the `CTA`_ science tools
and can also be used to analyse data from existing imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes
(IACTs), such as `H.E.S.S.`_, `MAGIC`_ and `VERITAS`_. It also provides some support
for `Fermi-LAT`_ and `HAWC`_ data analysis.
